      <description>Knowing about the ins and outs of the cloud is pretty useful when you are a data scientist. During the Microsoft Azure ertified Data &amp;amp; AI track of the Techonista Academy I will take 4 Microsoft exams and today I passed my first, the AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals, with flying colors.
This exam covers topics ranging from different cloud concepts, core Azure services and management tools to security features, compliance and privacy.</description>

      <description>People have asked me what coding environment I use for my projects. I started out with Anaconda which conveniently installed Python, Jupyter Notebook and all common libraries I needed for my projects. However, I found the process of installing new libraries quite complicated. I also ran into problems when I installed a version of Tensorflow that was not compatible with my version of Pandas. Even with the help of the Stackoverflow community this was a problem that I found hard to solve.</description>

      <description>I started my first machine learning course on Udemy in May 2020. I quickly realized two things. First, for me simply following along with these courses is not the best way to learn because it doesnâ€™t challenge me to think about a solution myself. And secondly, I was missing some basic knowledge on how to get started with a project. I mean, it is great to know how to perform a regression analysis, but preparing your data is a huge part of data science and this topic is not always covered in these courses.</description>
